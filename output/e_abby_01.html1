<h2>CIA involvement in Afganistan:</h2>

<p>Abby S. &gt; The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been heavily involved in Afghanistan since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989. Their primary goal has been to weaken the Taliban and strengthen the Northern Alliance through providing them with arms and other forms of support. They also sought to create a partition between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by encouraging the former to join the international community while isolating the latter.</p>
