   <media:description>As House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Biden prepare for their first face-to-face meeting this week to discuss raising the debt ceiling, we speak with Marxist economist Richard Wolff about why the limit on the federal government’s borrowing lets politicians avoid making hard choices about taxing the wealthy. House Republicans are pushing for major spending cuts as part of any deal to raise the federal government’s $31.4 trillion borrowing limit. “It’s 99% theatrics,” says Wolff, professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a visiting professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of The New School. Wolff also discusses the economic impact of the Ukraine war.

   <media:description>We speak with Marxist economist Richard Wolff about how experts forecast another economic recession in the United States, with inflation at a historic high and a federal minimum wage that hasn't changed for 13 years. The Federal Reserve plan to combat rising inflation by raising interest rates delivers a &quot;body blow to a working class&quot; already suffering from decades of upward wealth redistribution and a pandemic, says Wolff,  emeritus professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst and visiting professor at The New School. His latest book is &quot;The Sickness Is the System: When Capitalism Fails to Save Us from Pandemics or Itself.&quot;

   <media:description>Ever wonder how billionaires got so much richer during the pandemic while you and people you know struggled? Well, chalk it up to the stock market. Just 10% of Americans own 90% of stocks – so it's easy to see why the vast majority of people don't benefit from the market's gains when it performs well.&#13;
&#13;
So how exactly does the stock market work, who controls it and who wins out?&#13;
&#13;

00:52 How Does the Stock Market Work?&#13;
3:15 Who Controls the Stock Market?&#13;
4:28 How Shareholders Take Money From Workers&#13;
6:21 Are Stock Buybacks Market Manipulation?
7:25 What If Profits Went To Workers?&#13;

For this very special 100th episode, we're elevating house discourse by inviting two of the best minds on the left to interrogate the ethical questions that are driving the controversy. Marxist economist Richard Wolff and Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and theologian Chris Hedges weigh in on whether there is a moral maximum income, by what standard we should judge leftists who become wealthy in the course of their advocacy, and why the left is so easily distracted by superficial internecine battles, like the one over Hasan Piker's house, during this time of great crisis. We then move on to discuss more substantive divides on the left, and whether the so-called &quot;institutional left's&quot; theory of power is, in fact, demobilizing people at the very moment they should act. It's a banger.</media:description>

   <media:description>Economist and Professor Richard Wolff analyzes the deficiencies of modern capitalism, articulating the benefits of a socialist system and the road to a more equitable society. He promotes not a radical shift in economic system, but a gradual transformation involving a shift in consciousness from profits before people to people above all else.

   <media:description>Relations between Beijing and Washington are at a worrying new low as the two superpowers meet in Alaska for a tense, highly-anticipated summit. The Biden administration has just imposed a new round of sanctions of Chinese individuals and entities and referred to its government as &quot;insidious, corrosive and corrupt.&quot; Meanwhile, the Chinese economy is set to overtake that of the US in 2028.  RT America's Alex Mihailovich reports for the News with Rick Sanchez. Then economist and founder of Democracy at Work Prof. Richard Wolff shares his insights. 

The European Medical Agency (EMA) has completed its investigation into AstraZeneca's novel coronavirus vaccine and has deemed it &quot;safe and effective&quot; with benefits outweighing the risks. It nevertheless admits that its link to blood clots can't be entirely ruled out. RT America's Charlotte Dubenskij reports. 

A Florida healthcare worker gave birth to the first child born in the US with COVID-19 antibodies. She received her first dose of a novel coronavirus vaccine when 36 weeks pregnant. The news is being welcomed as a major triumph in the fight against COVID-19 and an auspicious sign pointing to a future beyond the pandemic. RT America's Trinity Chavez has the details. 

Plus, PFAS (or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a cause of growing concern. These toxic chemicals can cause cancer and other health problems, but trace amounts exist Styrofoam, water-proof makeup, and a host of other human-made materials. These so-called &quot;forever chemicals&quot; don't break down over time, making their impact on the environment even more harmful. RT America's Faran Fronczak reports.
