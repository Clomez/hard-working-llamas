   <media:description>The outlook for the UK has improved in recent months, with a technical recession now looking like it will be avoided, according to Bloomberg Economics. In fact, the team sees GDP growth in 2023 of 0.1%, up from -0.4%. 

Jim Mellon, chairman of Burnbrae, is predicting an even brighter picture. In this week’s In the City, he tells hosts David Merritt and Francine Lacqua to look out for 1 to 2% growth this year, thanks to a more stable government, an influx of migrants and gas prices falling sharply.

Is London having another moment? Shaken by Brexit, decimated by the pandemic, threatened by new ways of working and a worsening cost-of-living crisis, the city remains Europe’s (and arguably the world’s) beating heart for finance and for culture. In the wake of turmoil, The City of London is reinventing itself. Every week on In The City, Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua and David Merritt go behind the scenes in the Square Mile and the wider metropolis, uncovering the stories and speaking to the people that matter.

   <media:description>Iran and Saudi Arabia surprised many governments in March when they announced an agreement to restore diplomatic relations–ending a seven-year freeze.

Just as surprising: The deal was brokered by China.

Bloomberg correspondents Golnar Motevalli (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ARwAJnhPlhE/golnar-motevalli) and Sam Dagher (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AWJogUSTS88/sam-dagher) join this episode to explain how this landmark agreement came together and what each side hopes to gain from it.

And Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow for Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs, talks about China’s critical role in this deal and the nation’s growing ambitions as a global power broker.

   <media:description>Nassim Taleb has never been shy about expressing his viewpoints on a wide range of topics. But lately he's been getting into verbal tussles with people who have long looked up to his wisdom. Whether it's Bitcoiners, venture capitalists, deadlifters, or anti-vaxxers, many people within these communities have admired his philosophy of antifragility. So why has he taken to arguing with them on Twitter? What exactly are they getting wrong about his ideas? And for that matter, why has he himself gotten into cycling lately? In this wide ranging conversation, the author of books such as Antifragile, The Black Swan, and Fooled by Randomness talks about all these topics and more — including how to think about reducing tail risk in one's own life.

   <media:description>Tucked into President Biden’s massive Inflation Reduction Act is a pot of money–$15 million–for the Internal Revenue Service to study a long-talked-about idea: Building an online IRS platform that would enable taxpayers to file their taxes easily and for free. If it moves ahead, it could mean an end to frustratingly complex forms and fees to accountants and tax prep companies.

There are plenty of obstacles in the way. Some politicians and industry groups in Washington are already lining up against it. And it’s not clear Americans would trust the IRS to calculate their refund–or how much they owe.

Bloomberg reporters Laura Davison (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASABRnBnppM/laura-davison), Brody Ford (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AVFMLHVLs6o/brody-ford), and Ben Steverman (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/APyzp7f-aN0/ben-steverman) join this episode to talk about the promise—and potential pitfalls—of a public filing option for all.

   <media:description>Berlin is the epicenter of one of the most grotesque authoritarian moments in world history: the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime, and all of the horrors that flowed out of that. To consider that history, and the possible threats from authoritarianism in the present, Tim asked his colleague Andreas Kluth, who writes about politics and national security for Bloomberg Opinion, to be his tour guide around the city. Together, they examined three landmark sites – the Reichstag building, Hitler’s bunker, and the Holocaust Memorial – to see what can be learned from the past.

Hosted by Bloomberg Opinion senior executive editor Tim O'Brien, Crash Course will bring listeners directly into the arenas where epic business and social upheavals occur. Every week, Crash Course will explore the lessons to be learned when creativity and ambition collide with competition and power -- on Wall Street and Main Street, and in Hollywood and Washington.

   <media:description>There’s been a ton of news coverage and commentary around Donald Trump’s indictment in New York on Thursday. But the Manhattan case is only one of several criminal investigations and civil cases swirling around the former president—from the US Justice Department’s inquiry into the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol and the investigation of Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, to probes of Trump’s business practices. 

Bloomberg legal reporters Zoe Tillman (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AV4iFHxuN3g/zoe-tillman) and Erik Larson (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AOncX4IdfmA/erik-larson) join this episode to look beyond the Manhattan indictment and assess Trump’s other legal entanglements, and where things go from here.

   <media:description>For the most part, being a landlord, particularly in a major city, has been a good business to be in. Rents historically just go up — as so do property prices. And there are multiple other ways to make money, as well. Plus, historically, politicians didn't care much about the rights of renters, focusing much more on the concerns of homeowners. But the politics might be changing. And if the politics are changing, then the economics may change as well. On this episode of the podcast, we speak with Ben Carlos Thypin, a residential and commercial landlord in New York City, who tells us the golden age of being a landlord is over and why he plans to get out of residential real estate completely.

   <media:description>Last May, the Oak Ridge National Lab, run by the US Department of Energy, unveiled Frontier–the world's fastest supercomputer. It’s capable of performing a quintillion calculations per second, breaking what's called the exascale barrier. 

The system requires its own power plant, 6,000 gallons of water to keep it cool, and a highly trained staff to operate. So what can it do? And who gets to use it?

We set out for Knoxville, Tennessee to try to wrap our brains around Frontier’s limitless potential.

   <media:description>If there’s one thing that keeps professional investors up at night, it’s being involved in a “crowded trade.” In other words, a position that’s become so popular that there are few investors left to get involved with it, so there’s risk of painful losses for all if the crowd heads for the exits.

That’s part of the appeal of microcap stocks for Patrick McDonough (), a portfolio manager at PGIM Quantitative Solutions. He joined the What Goes Up podcast to explain his approach to analyzing these smaller, younger companies whose values are often measured in millions, rather than billions, of dollars. Since many investors are more comfortable with bigger, more-established companies, microcaps offer a unique and overlooked source of growth.

“It’s something that people have historically avoided,” McDonough says. “Which means it’s not crowded. So it’s an area we can go in and get a lot of upside.”

   <media:description>If you’re a working parent, finding childcare is almost certainly a source of stress in your life. It’s often a struggle to find an opening and when you do, it can be crazy expensive. This presents a tough choice: pay for childcare to be able to work, or become a caregiver and forgo a second income. And for single parents, there is no choice at all.

Bloomberg reporter Olivia Konotey-Ahulu (https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUJMU8_Nfus/olivia-konoteyahulu) has been covering the growing discontent of parents in the UK. And Simon Workman is co-founder of Prenatal to Five Fiscal Strategies, which consults with US states to find ways to support the needs of young children and their families. They both join this episode to look at how the US and UK can fix their broken childcare systems–and highlight countries that are doing it right.

   <media:description>Jim O’Neill, the former UK Conservative minister and Goldman Sachs chief economist, says he doesn’t miss being in banking. And no, he wouldn’t accept an offer like we saw with Sergio Ermotti returning as chief executive at UBS. But when asked on this week’s episode of In the City whether he can explain what’s happening in the industry right now, he’s got some ideas. He also weighs in on the race to buy Manchester United, questioning whether the football club is worth its more than £4 billion price tag.

Is London having another moment? Shaken by Brexit, decimated by the pandemic, threatened by new ways of working and a worsening cost-of-living crisis, the city remains Europe’s (and arguably the world’s) beating heart for finance and for culture. In the wake of turmoil, The City of London is reinventing itself. Every week on In The City, Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua and David Merritt go behind the scenes in the Square Mile and the wider metropolis, uncovering the stories and speaking to the people that matter.

   <media:description>One of the big mysteries in markets right now is why risk assets rallied so strongly into the new year even as policymakers were adamant that they would continue to go hard on inflation by raising rates. Sure, there have been some recent signs of a &quot;soft&quot; or even &quot;no landing&quot; scenario, but a lot of the price action seemed pretty dramatic, with investors dashing back to meme and tech stocks that were beaten down last year. Matt King, Citigroup strategist and Odd Lots favorite, has one explanation for the recent &quot;dash for trash.&quot; He argues that even though many central banks around the world have announced that they're winding down several years of extraordinarily loose monetary policies, they've actually been adding liquidity to the financial system in recent months — almost $1 trillion of it. Now, he argues, that extra liquidity is going away and it isn't at all clear if private businesses and investment will fill the gap.

   <media:description>Imagine you couldn’t take another breath because oxygen disappeared. You gasp for air until your body shuts down. Money provides oxygen to our economy. When the money flow slows, so does the economy. If money stops circulating, the economy seizes. Like your body deprived of oxygen, it shuts down. That’s why banking crises freak out people. Banks are the lungs of a thriving economy, oxygenating everything with money. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed recently, a debacle that exposed fault lines running beneath a legendary financial ecosystem. But it was just one bank. Since then, though, other banks have run into trouble. Sitting atop that uncertainty is the Federal Reserve, the powerhouse that sets interest rates – and thus governs how easy it is for money to course through the economy. To help solve that mystery, Tim spoke with Paul Davies, a financial columnist for Bloomberg Opinion and somebody steeped in the chaos that can happen when banks and money collide with human frailty – and the power of the Fed.
