#### Dr. Hubert, Can you tell about the benefits of deliberate heat exposure, for short time. in detail
Deliberate heat exposure can have multiple beneficial effects on the body. As mentioned earlier, it is one of the most effective ways to increase metabolism and burn calories. It also helps to boost blood circulation, which in turn helps with carrying nutrients and oxygen to cells and tissues. Heat also has anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects, making it beneficial for sore muscles or joint pains.
